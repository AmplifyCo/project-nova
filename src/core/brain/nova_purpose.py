"""Nova's Purpose — defines WHY Nova exists and WHAT it proactively cares about.

This module is the "soul" of Nova: a set of purpose-driven behaviors that guide
proactivity and curiosity. It tells the AttentionEngine not just HOW to observe,
but WHAT to look for and WHEN — turning a reactive assistant into a purposeful one.

Architecture:
    nova_purpose.py  (WHAT and WHEN — purpose drives)
           ↓
    attention_engine.py  (HOW — runtime loop, Telegram delivery, dedup)

Purpose drives (Full AGI):
    1. Morning briefing (7:30–9am)   — Today's agenda, events, follow-ups
    2. Evening summary  (7–9pm)      — What was done, what's pending tomorrow
    3. Weekly look-ahead (Sunday 6pm) — 7-day horizon: deadlines, events, prep
    4. Curiosity scan   (every 6h)   — Interesting patterns, connections, observations
    5. Spontaneous interest (any)    — Surface unexpected things unprompted

Security: All prompts operate within Nova's existing security guardrails.
No raw PII, no message content — only summaries and observations from memory.
